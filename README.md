## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/summer_internship_for_tech_excellence/prework]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[A major challenge I encountered when creating this submission was my lack of experience with JavaScript. I have had some minor experience in creatinng web templates with html and css but have never worked with javaScript. It was challenging at first
and I still have a lot to improve but I feel like, because of this submission, I have a basic understanding of how it works and when to best use it. I have also
been taking advantage of my Github membership and their student developer pack to improve my skills with websites like Frontend Masters.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I have some questions about what the different types of areas there are within web development just so that 
I can learn more about them and see if they interest me. I would also like to know what the most in demand
skills are relating to web development or if employers seek personal projects more.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I would try to update the title and words to make them look a little better. I would also maybe like to add more squares or to make the countdown quicker when it shows you the clues. 
I would also like to fix the issue that I was having where the sound would play in the Glitch window but when you go the the url, it would have no sound. I would also just like to 
improve basic things so that the game is easier and more enjoyably played.]
